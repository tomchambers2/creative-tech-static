	<p>Codepoetry is an urban poetry game. Scattered QR codes invite you to discover the poetry hidden in unexpected places. With the help of a smartphone you scan the QR code you found and it leads you to a random poem from the constantly updated online collection. Visit the <a href="http://codepoetry.gr">project's site</a> for more information.</p>
