	<h2>Recycling scripts</h2>

	<p>Recycling Scripts is an interactive installation commissioned by artist <a href="http://yukiuebo.com">Yuki Uebo</a> that allows people to take on a dating alter ego. We worked closely with Yuki to develop the iPad application to her specifications.</p>

	<h3>Concept</h3>
	<p>The app allows the user to take on the role of various individuals on dating websites. When chatting with a dating match, the app prompts the user to respond in the voice of a famous person. The scripts are derived from films, speeches and interviews. At any time the user is offered a choice of what role they want to adopt and how they want to respond. The only thing they're unable to do is to respond as themselves.</p>

	<p>For this iteration of the application the chosen characters were ‘empowered’ post-feminist politician Hilary Clinton, Disney Princess, little girls’ dream, to Marilyn Monroe, ‘the ultimate sex symbol for men’.</p>

	<h3>Technology</h3>
	<p>To allow for very fast deployments, especially remotely while the app was being used, the app is a website hosted on Heroku written in node.js. The application makes use of the unofficial Tinder API to get users details, create matches and send messages which are then displayed on a custom front end.</p>

	<p>A piece of express middleware parses responses to the user, decides an appropriate category using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and then displays a set of appropriate responses for the alter ego characters that the user is able to take on.</p>
